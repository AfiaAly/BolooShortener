This project is the Software Engineer assessment for Boloo, where I will be creating a simple URL Shortener single-page application. The application will be built using Django and Django REST Framework for the back-end, and Bootstrap for the front-end. It will be shared as a public repository on GitHub, and can be run locally as a development server.

Here we go.
