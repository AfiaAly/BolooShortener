This project is the Software Engineer assessment for Boloo, where I will be creating a simple URL Shortener single-page application. The application will be built using Django and Django REST Framework for the back-end, and Bootstrap for the front-end. It will be shared as a public repository on GitHub, and can be run locally as a development server.

Here we go.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the server using `python manage.py runserver`
